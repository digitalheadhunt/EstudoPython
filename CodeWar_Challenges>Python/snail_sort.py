"""
Snail Sort
Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost 
elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest; the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.
